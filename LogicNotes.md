##Logic Notes

 - **Change the trump card**
	 - Changing trump can be non-optimal when:
           1. Current player is planning to close the game and don't want to give additional points to his opponent
           2. The player will close the game and you will give him additional points by giving him bigger trump card instead of 9
           3. Want to confuse the opponent
